# ESM 206 Coding Lesson - Week 9

### Part 1: Multiple linear regression model evaluation & comparison

Expanding on the penguins multiple linear regression from last week, we will compare different permutations of the model, explore collinearity, and make a finalized table of regression outcome(s).

Data exist in built-in **penguins** dataset in the `palmerpenguins` R package.

**Data from:** Gorman KB, Williams TD, Fraser WR (2014). Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a community of Antarctic penguins (genus Pygoscelis). PLoS ONE 9(3):e90081. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081

### Part 2: Chi-square

In this example, we will ask: is there an association between lizard species and tail breakage? Also includes: wrangling, counts, visualization & communication. 

Data are in data/ as 'lizards.csv'
